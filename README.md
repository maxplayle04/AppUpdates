## S136CUpdates
This is the file containing version information which Section136Callouts checks for on startup if you have it enabled in the configuration file. The code for Section136Callouts is stored elsewhere in a private repository, so please - don't try and find it!

When an update (or early access build) is released; I'll change the corresponding version number in this repository to trigger the update notification in-game.

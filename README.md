## AppUpdates
Users of my software have no reason to look into or be concerned about this repository. It contains files which contain hashed data which is used by my various applicaitons and projects. No reference to the corresponding project is made in any of these files, and these files exist simply as a way of editing them on-the-fly rather than embedding them within the actual application.

# Once again, nobody has any reason to actually look into this repository! You've no business here.

A lot of what this repository contains is files with version strings, which are used by my various update checkers to alert users to new updates. All of the files are read-only, and no data that isn't encrypted/hashed in some way isn't publicly accessible using my applications.
